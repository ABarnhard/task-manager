#####The app for people who hate Google Calendar

No, it doesn't sync to your fancy phone or send out reminders.
This marvel of modern engineering is a simple command line app
that adds data to different arrays based on user input.

Please note, the inability to remove completed tasks from the list
isn't a flaw, it is a desing feature. Using this app you will always
have the reminder of just how much you've accomplished.

This app demonstrates:
* Use of sync-prompt Node module
* Use of chalk Node module
* Conditionally adding data to seperate arrays based on user input
* High level badassery (Did you see those colors?!?!)
